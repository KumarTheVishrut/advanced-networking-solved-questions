## ✅ **Short Questions (Verbose Answers)**

1. **Difference between SONET and SDH:**

   SONET (Synchronous Optical Network) and SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy) are standardized multiplexing protocols that transfer multiple digital bit streams using lasers or light over optical fiber. SONET is developed by ANSI (American National Standards Institute) and is primarily used in North America, whereas SDH is the international version developed by ITU-T.

   - SONET's base rate is 51.84 Mbps (OC-1), while SDH starts at 155.52 Mbps (STM-1).
   - SDH structures are more hierarchical and flexible compared to SONET.
   - Both support synchronous transmission, but differ in framing, terminology, and rate levels.

2. **Roles of ATM Adaptation Layer (AAL):**

   The ATM Adaptation Layer is responsible for adapting user traffic into 48-byte payloads suitable for ATM cells and reassembling them at the destination. It serves various applications like voice, video, and data by offering specific service classes:

   - **Segmentation and Reassembly (SAR)** of higher layer data.
   - **Error detection** and **handling**.
   - Supports various service classes via AAL types (AAL1, AAL2, AAL5).
   - Facilitates timing and synchronization where needed.

   - Suitable for **backbone and long-haul** communication systems.

6. **Difference between Unicast and Multicast Routing:**

   - **Unicast** routing involves sending data from one source to one destination.

   - Multicast conserves bandwidth and reduces load on source and intermediate routers, used in live video streaming or video conferencing.

7. **Role of Remote Monitoring in Network Management:**

   Remote Monitoring (RMON) allows administrators to manage and monitor network devices and performance from a centralized location.

   - Often integrated with SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol).
   - Improves **network reliability** and **uptime**.

8. **Purpose of Dynamic Routing:**

   Dynamic routing allows routers to automatically discover and maintain route information based on changing network conditions.

   - Adapts to **topology changes** or **link failures**.
   - Automatically **updates routing tables**.
   - Uses algorithms like **Bellman-Ford (RIP)** or **Dijkstra (OSPF)**.
   - Ensures **optimal path selection** without manual configuration.

## ✅ **Long Questions (Verbose Answers)**

1. **Structure and Working of SONET and SDH:**

   SONET and SDH are both standardized protocols for optical transmission. They use frames, which are structured units of data with overhead and payload. These frames repeat every 125 microseconds and support synchronous transmission.

   - SDH frames are hierarchical: STM-1 (155 Mbps), STM-4 (622 Mbps), etc.
   - SONET's corresponding levels are OC-3, OC-12, etc.
   - Multiplexes lower-rate signals and provides robust fault-tolerance and management features.
   - Used widely in telecom infrastructure.

2. **Packet Switching: Concept, Types, and Difference from Circuit Switching:**

   **Packet switching** divides data into packets and sends each independently across the network.

   - **Types:**
     - **Datagram** packet switching (like UDP) – no fixed path.
     - **Virtual circuit** packet switching (like TCP) – logical path is established.
   - In contrast, **Circuit Switching** sets up a dedicated path (used in traditional telephony).
   - Packet switching is more efficient and reliable in data networks.

3. **ATM Reference Model and Its Layers:**

   The ATM Reference Model includes:
   - **Physical Layer**: Converts bits into signals.
   - **ATM Layer**: Manages cells, headers, switching, and multiplexing.
   - **ATM Adaptation Layer (AAL)**: Adapts different types of services into 48-byte payloads.

   ATM is connection-oriented, supports QoS, and uses fixed-size cells (53 bytes) for fast processing.

4. **Explain the Roles of ATM Adaptation Layer and its Benefits:**

   - AAL ensures compatibility between upper-layer services and ATM's cell-based structure.
   - AAL1 supports constant bit rate (CBR) for voice/video.
   - AAL5 supports variable bit rate (VBR) for data.
   - Benefits include flexibility, support for diverse traffic, and error handling.

5. **Unicast and Multicast Routing Protocols with Real-World Examples:**

   - **Unicast** protocols: RIP (simple networks), OSPF (enterprise), BGP (internet backbone).

   - Multicast is more efficient for applications like live video where the same data is sent to many recipients.

6. **Remote Monitoring Techniques: Polling vs. Traps:**

   - **Polling**: Network manager periodically requests data from devices.
     - Pro: Controlled; Con: High bandwidth use.
